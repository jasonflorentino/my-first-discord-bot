# ðŸ¤– My First Discord Bot
*Nothing fancy. Just playing around with DiscordJS.* ðŸ˜Š

### Feel free to use this code
- You'll first need to create a bot from your Discord account and get a Token to plug into your `.env`
- I just used Node to run the bot locally from my computer. You'll need [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you want to do the same.
- I've made a gif command using Tenor's API. If you want to use that command you'll need to get yourself an API key from [Tenor](https://tenor.com/) and put it in your `.env`

**Thanks for stopping by,**
